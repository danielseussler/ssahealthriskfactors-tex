  abstract = {Background               Substantial inequalities exist in childhood vaccination coverage levels. To increase vaccine uptake, factors that predict vaccination coverage in children should be identified and addressed.                                         Methods                                Using data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey and geospatial data sets, we fitted Bayesian multilevel binomial and multinomial logistic regression models to analyse independent predictors of three vaccination outcomes: receipt of the first dose of Pentavalent vaccine (containing diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis,                 Hemophilus influenzae                 type B and Hepatitis B vaccines) (PENTA1) (n = 6059) and receipt of the third dose having received the first (PENTA3/1) (n = 3937) in children aged 12–23 months, and receipt of measles vaccine (MV) (n = 11839) among children aged 12–35 months.                                                        Results               Factors associated with vaccination were broadly similar for documented versus recall evidence of vaccination. Based on any evidence of vaccination, we found that health card/document ownership, receipt of vitamin A and maternal educational level were significantly associated with each outcome. Although the coverage of each vaccine dose was higher in urban than rural areas, urban residence was not significant in multivariable analyses that included travel time. Indicators relating to socio-economic status, as well as ethnic group, skilled birth attendance, lower travel time to the nearest health facility and problems seeking health care were significantly associated with both PENTA1 and MV. Maternal religion was related to PENTA1 and PENTA3/1 and maternal age related to MV and PENTA3/1; other significant variables were associated with one outcome each. Substantial residual community level variances in different strata were observed in the fitted models for each outcome.                                         Conclusion               Our analysis has highlighted socio-demographic and health care access factors that affect not only beginning but completing the vaccination series in Nigeria. Other factors not measured by the DHS such as health service quality and community attitudes should also be investigated and addressed to tackle inequities in coverage.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many low- and middle-income countries, causing widespread food insecurity and a sharp decline in living standards1. In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have distributed social assistance to more than 1.5 billion people2. Targeting is a central challenge in administering these programmes: it remains a difficult task to rapidly identify those with the greatest need given available data3,4. Here we show that data from mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of humanitarian assistance. Our approach uses traditional survey data to train machine-learning algorithms to recognize patterns of poverty in mobile phone data; the trained algorithms can then prioritize aid to the poorest mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying a flagship emergency cash transfer program in Togo, which used these algorithms to disburse millions of US dollars worth of COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes—including exclusion errors, total social welfare and measures of fairness—under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo, the machine-learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4–21\%. Relative to methods requiring a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine-learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9–35\%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to complement traditional methods for targeting humanitarian assistance, particularly in crisis settings in which traditional data are missing or out of date.}

Improvements in height-for-age in pre-schoolers are associated with increased height as a young adult and number of grades of schooling completed.

  abstract = {The age-group composition of populations varies considerably across the world, and obtaining accurate, spatially detailed estimates of numbers of children under 5 years is important in designing vaccination strategies, educational planning or maternal healthcare delivery. Traditionally, such estimates are derived from population censuses, but these can often be unreliable, outdated and of coarse resolution for resource-poor settings. Focusing on Nigeria, we use nationally representative household surveys and their cluster locations to predict the proportion of the under-five population in 1 × 1 km using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model. Results showed that land cover, travel time to major settlements, night-time lights and vegetation index were good predictors and that accounting for fine-scale variation, rather than assuming a uniform proportion of under 5 year olds can result in significant differences in health metrics. The largest gaps in estimated bednet and vaccination coverage were in Kano, Katsina and Jigawa. Geolocated household surveys are a valuable resource for providing detailed, contemporary and regularly updated population age-structure data in the absence of recent census data. By combining these with covariate layers, age-structure maps of unprecedented detail can be produced to guide the targeting of interventions in resource-poor settings.},

For example, estimates of the number of women of reproductive age are important to understand the population at risk to maternal mortality and unmet need for contraception. However, in many low-income countries, data on population counts and components of population change are limited, and so levels and trends subnationally are unclear. We present a Bayesian constrained cohort component model for the estimation and projection of subnational populations. The model builds on a cohort component projection framework, incorporates census data and estimates from the United Nation's World Population Prospects, and uses characteristic mortality schedules to obtain estimates of population counts and the components of population change, including internal migration. The data required as inputs to the model are minimal and available across a wide range of countries, including most low-income countries. The model is applied to estimate and project populations by county in Kenya for 1979-2019, and validated against the 2019 Kenyan census.},

  abstract = {Measuring and forecasting migration patterns has important implications for understanding broader population trends, for designing policy effectively and for allocating resources. However, data on migration and mobility are often lacking, and those that do exist are not available in a timely manner. Social media data offer new opportunities to provide more up-to-date demographic estimates and to complement more traditional data sources. Facebook’s Advertising Platform, for example, is a potentially rich data source of demographic information that is regularly updated. However, Facebook’s users are not representative of the underlying population. This paper proposes a statistical framework to combine social media data with traditional survey data to produce timely ‘nowcasts’ of migrant stocks by state in the United States. The model incorporates bias adjustment of Facebook data, and a pooled principal component time series approach, to account for correlations across age, time and space. We use the model to estimate and project migrants from Mexico, India and Germany, three migrant groups with varying levels and trends of migration in the US. By comparing short-term projections with data from the American Community Survey, we show that the model predictions outperform alternatives that rely solely on either social media or survey data.},

However, for the great majority of developing countries without well-functioning vital registration systems, estimating the U5MR is challenging due to limited data availability and data quality issues. We describe a Bayesian penalized B-spline regression model for assessing levels and trends in the U5MR for all countries in the world, whereby biases in data series are estimated through the inclusion of a multilevel model to improve upon the limitations of current methods. B-spline smoothing parameters are also estimated through a multilevel model. Improved spline extrapolations are obtained through logarithmic pooling of the posterior predictive distribution of country-specific changes in spline coefficients with observed changes on the global level. The proposed model is able to flexibly capture changes in U5MR over time, gives point estimates and credible intervals reflecting potential biases in data series and performs reasonably well in out-of-sample validation exercises. It has been accepted by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation to generate estimates for all member countries.},

We estimate ENSO’s association with child nutrition at global scale by combining variation in ENSO intensity from 1986-2018 with children’s height and weight from 186 surveys conducted in 51 teleconnected countries, containing 48\% of the world’s under-5 population. Warmer El Niño conditions predict worse child undernutrition in most of the developing world, but better outcomes in the small number of areas where precipitation is positively affected by warmer ENSO. ENSO’s contemporaneous effects on child weight loss are detectable years later as decreases in height. This relationship looks similar at both global and regional scale, and has not appreciably weakened over the last four decades. Results imply that almost 6 million additional children were underweight during the 2015 El Niño compared to a counterfactual of neutral ENSO conditions in 2015. This demonstrates a pathway through which human well-being remains subject to predictable climatic processes.},

  abstract = {This report focuses on the well-being of children age 0-17 using 10 outcomes in four domains: nutrition, health care, schooling, and child protection. The data used in the analysis were obtained from recent surveys conducted by The Demographic and Health Surveys Program, one survey in each of 30 countries selected on the basis of USAID priorities or low levels of the Human Development Index. The analysis describes the relationship between each outcome and risk factors at the levels of the child, household, and sample cluster. The working hypothesis, based on empirical generalizations found in the literature, was that risk factors would correspond with negative outcomes for all indicators in all countries. However, to the contrary, it is found that the effect of most risk factors cannot be generalized across all outcomes or all countries. For example, the effect of household structure, represented by the presence of biological parents and the relationship of the child to the household head, tends to be stronger for the child protection and schooling outcomes than for other outcomes, but this relationship is not consistent across all countries. The index of household crowding�the number of household members per room�has a strong association with most outcomes across all the surveys, but this generalization does not hold for schooling and birth registration. The analysis implies that the impact on child outcomes of household structure and other household-level or community-level variables can vary, sometimes substantially, across countries.}

  abstract = {Malaria transmission largely depends on environmental, climatic, and hydrological conditions. In Mali, malaria epidemiological patterns are nested within three ecological zones. This study aimed at assessing the relationship between those conditions and the incidence of malaria in Dangassa and Koila, Mali. Malaria data was collected through passive case detection at community health facilities of each study site from June 2015 to January 2017. Climate and environmental data were obtained over the same time period from the Goddard Earth Sciences (Giovanni) platform and hydrological data from Mali hydraulic services. A generalized additive model was used to determine the lagged time between each principal component analysis derived component and the incidence of malaria cases, and also used to analyze the relationship between malaria and the lagged components in a multivariate approach. Malaria transmission patterns were bimodal at both sites, but peak and lull periods were longer lasting for Koila study site. Temperatures were associated with malaria incidence in both sites. In Dangassa, the wind speed (p = 0.005) and river heights (p = 0.010) contributed to increasing malaria incidence, in contrast to Koila, where it was humidity (p {$<$} 0.001) and vegetation (p = 0.004). The relationships between environmental factors and malaria incidence differed between the two settings, implying different malaria dynamics and adjustments in the conception and plan of interventions.},

However, researchers, policy makers, and citizens who want to make use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) have little information about whether it can be relied upon in a particular geographic setting. In this paper, we use two complementary, independent methods to assess the completeness of OSM road data in each country in the world. First, we undertake a visual assessment of OSM data against satellite imagery, which provides the input for estimates based on a multilevel regression and poststratification model. Second, we fit sigmoid curves to the cumulative length of contributions, and use them to estimate the saturation level for each country. Both techniques may have more general use for assessing the development and saturation of crowd-sourced data. Our results show that in many places, researchers and policymakers can rely on the completeness of OSM, or will soon be able to do so. We find (i) that globally, OSM is ∼83\% complete, and more than 40\% of countries—including several in the developing world—have a fully mapped street network; (ii) that well-governed countries with good Internet access tend to be more complete, and that completeness has a U-shaped relationship with population density—both sparsely populated areas and dense cities are the best mapped; and (iii) that existing global datasets used by the World Bank undercount roads by more than 30\%.},

  abstract = {Cross-validation is a widely-used technique to estimate prediction error, but its behavior is complex and not fully understood. Ideally, one would like to think that cross-validation estimates the prediction error for the model at hand, fit to the training data. We prove that this is not the case for the linear model fit by ordinary least squares; rather it estimates the average prediction error of models fit on other unseen training sets drawn from the same population. We further show that this phenomenon occurs for most popular estimates of prediction error, including data splitting, bootstrapping, and Mallow's Cp. Next, the standard confidence intervals for prediction error derived from cross-validation may have coverage far below the desired level. Because each data point is used for both training and testing, there are correlations among the measured accuracies for each fold, and so the usual estimate of variance is too small. We introduce a nested cross-validation scheme to estimate this variance more accurately, and we show empirically that this modification leads to intervals with approximately correct coverage in many examples where traditional cross-validation intervals fail.},

The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients. We anticipate the new maps will be useful for numerous applications, including species and vegetation distribution modeling.

  abstract = {Maps of infectious disease—charting spatial variations in the force of infection, degree of endemicity and the burden on human health—provide an essential evidence base to support planning towards global health targets. Contemporary disease mapping efforts have embraced statistical modelling approaches to properly acknowledge uncertainties in both the available measurements and their spatial interpolation. The most common such approach is Gaussian process regression, a mathematical framework composed of two components: a mean function harnessing the predictive power of multiple independent variables, and a covariance function yielding spatio-temporal shrinkage against residual variation from the mean. Though many techniques have been developed to improve the flexibility and fitting of the covariance function, models for the mean function have typically been restricted to simple linear terms. For infectious diseases, known to be driven by complex interactions between environmental and socio-economic factors, improved modelling of the mean function can greatly boost predictive power. Here, we present an ensemble approach based on stacked generalization that allows for multiple nonlinear algorithmic mean functions to be jointly embedded within the Gaussian process framework. We apply this method to mapping Plasmodium falciparum prevalence data in sub-Saharan Africa and show that the generalized ensemble approach markedly outperforms any individual method.},

This paper specifically draws attention to the fact that assessing model accuracy is a crucial aspect in the meta-modeling framework. Resampling strategies such as cross-validation, subsampling, bootstrapping, and nested resampling are prominent methods for model validation and are systematically discussed with respect to possible pitfalls, shortcomings, and specific features. A survey of meta-modeling techniques within evolutionary optimization is provided. In addition, practical examples illustrating some of the pitfalls associated with model selection and performance assessment are presented. Finally, recommendations are given for choosing a model validation technique for a particular setting.}

These cross-cohort changes coincided with childhood exposure to the campaigns rather than to pre-existing trends. Estimates suggest a substantial, though not predominant, role for malaria in explaining cross-region differences in income. (JEL I12, I18, J13, O15)},

  abstract = {Summary             Future climate change is predicted to diminish essential natural resource availability in many regions and perhaps globally. The resulting scarcity of water, food and livelihoods could lead to increasingly desperate populations that challenge governments, enhancing the risk of intra- and interstate conflict. Defence establishments and some political scientists view climate change as a potential threat to peace. While the medical literature increasingly recognises climate change as a fundamental health risk, the dimension of climate change-associated conflict has so far received little attention, despite its profound health implications. Many analysts link climate change with a heightened risk of conflict via causal pathways which involve diminishing or changing resource availability. Plausible consequences include: increased frequency of civil conflict in developing countries; terrorism, asymmetric warfare, state failure; and major regional conflicts. The medical understanding of these threats is inadequate, given the scale of health implications. The medical and public health communities have often been reluctant to interpret conflict as a health issue. However, at times, medical workers have proven powerful and effective peace advocates, most notably with regard to nuclear disarmament. The public is more motivated to mitigate climate change when it is framed as a health issue. Improved medical understanding of the association between climate change and conflict could strengthen mitigation efforts and increase cooperation to cope with the climate change that is now inevitable.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic machine learning increasingly informs critical decisions in medicine, economics, politics, and beyond. We need evidence to support that the resulting decisions are well-founded. To aid development of trust in these decisions, we develop a taxonomy delineating where trust in an analysis can break down: (1) in the translation of real-world goals to goals on a particular set of available training data, (2) in the translation of abstract goals on the training data to a concrete mathematical problem, (3) in the use of an algorithm to solve the stated mathematical problem, and (4) in the use of a particular code implementation of the chosen algorithm. We detail how trust can fail at each step and illustrate our taxonomy with two case studies: an analysis of the efficacy of microcredit and The Economist's predictions of the 2020 US presidential election. Finally, we describe a wide variety of methods that can be used to increase trust at each step of our taxonomy. The use of our taxonomy highlights steps where existing research work on trust tends to concentrate and also steps where establishing trust is particularly challenging.},

  abstract = {Advances in remote sensing and machine learning enable increasingly accurate, inexpensive, and timely estimation of poverty and malnutrition indicators to guide development and humanitarian agencies’ programming. However, state of the art models often rely on proprietary data and/or deep or transfer learning methods whose underlying mechanics may be challenging to interpret. We demonstrate how interpretable random forest models can produce estimates of a set of (potentially correlated) malnutrition and poverty prevalence measures using free, open access, regularly updated, georeferenced data. We demonstrate two use cases: contemporaneous prediction, which might be used for poverty mapping, geographic targeting, or monitoring and evaluation tasks, and a sequential nowcasting task that can inform early warning systems. Applied to data from 11 low and lower-middle income countries, we find predictive accuracy broadly comparable for both tasks to prior studies that use proprietary data and/or deep or transfer learning methods.},

  abstract = {Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2—to end preventable child deaths by 2030—we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000–2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32\% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58\% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the existence of a link between the long-term exposure to malaria and the frequency of civil conflicts in Africa. Using geographically disaggregated data at the level of grid cells the analysis provides empirical evidence for a hump-shaped relationship between the long-run stability and force of malaria transmission and the incidence of civil violence. In line with epidemiological predictions about the acquired immunity to malaria, cells that are characterized by intermediate malaria exposure exhibit higher conflict incidence than cells with very low or very high malaria exposure. We explore the role of the expansion of anti-malaria policies after 2005 in the context of the Roll Back Malaria programme. The results provide suggestive evidence that anti-malaria interventions reduced the incidence of civil violence, but only in areas where adults lack acquired immunity to malaria.}

  abstract = {The sex ratio at birth (SRB) is defined as the ratio of male to female live births. The SRB imbalance in parts of the world over the past several decades is a direct consequence of sex-selective abortion, driven by the coexistence of son preference, readily available technology of prenatal sex determination and fertility decline. Estimation and projection of the degree of SRB imbalance is complicated because of variability in SRB reference levels and because of the uncertainty associated with SRB observations. We develop Bayesian hierarchical time series mixture models for SRB estimation and scenario-based projections for all countries from 1950 to 2100. We model the SRB regional and national reference levels and the fluctuation around national reference levels. We identify countries at risk of SRB imbalances and model both: (i) the absence or presence of sex ratio transitions in such countries and, if present, (ii) the transition process. The transition model of SRB imbalance captures three stages (increase, stagnation and convergence back to SRB baselines). The model identifies countries with statistical evidence of SRB inflation in a fully Bayesian approach. The scenario-based SRB projections are based on the sex ratio transition model with varying assumptions regarding the occurrence of a sex ratio transition in at-risk countries. Projections are used to quantify the future burden of missing female births due to sex-selective abortions under different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Significance             Many critical policy decisions rely on data about the geographic distribution of wealth and poverty, yet only half of all countries have access to adequate data on poverty. This paper creates a complete and publicly available set of microestimates of the distribution of relative poverty and wealth across all 135 low- and middle-income countries. We provide extensive evidence of the accuracy and validity of the estimates and also provide confidence intervals for each microestimate to facilitate responsible downstream use. These methods and maps provide a set of tools to study economic development and growth, guide interventions, monitor and evaluate policies, and track the elimination of poverty worldwide.           ,              Many critical policy decisions, from strategic investments to the allocation of humanitarian aid, rely on data about the geographic distribution of wealth and poverty. Yet many poverty maps are out of date or exist only at very coarse levels of granularity. Here we develop microestimates of the relative wealth and poverty of the populated surface of all 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) at 2.4 km resolution. The estimates are built by applying machine-learning algorithms to vast and heterogeneous data from satellites, mobile phone networks, and topographic maps, as well as aggregated and deidentified connectivity data from Facebook. We train and calibrate the estimates using nationally representative household survey data from 56 LMICs and then validate their accuracy using four independent sources of household survey data from 18 countries. We also provide confidence intervals for each microestimate to facilitate responsible downstream use. These estimates are provided free for public use in the hope that they enable targeted policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide the foundation for insights into the causes and consequences of economic development and growth, and promote responsible policymaking in support of sustainable development.},

  abstract = {In practice, machine learning (ML) workflows require various different steps, from data preprocessing, missing value imputation, model selection, to model tuning as well as model evaluation. Many of these steps rely on human ML experts. AutoML - the field of automating these ML pipelines - tries to help practitioners to apply ML off-the-shelf without any expert knowledge. Most modern AutoML systems like auto-sklearn, H20-AutoML or TPOT aim for high predictive performance, thereby generating ensembles that consist almost exclusively of black-box models. This, in turn, makes the interpretation for the layperson more intricate and adds another layer of opacity for users. We propose an AutoML system that constructs an interpretable additive model that can be fitted using a highly scalable componentwise boosting algorithm. Our system provides tools for easy model interpretation such as visualizing partial effects and pairwise interactions, allows for a straightforward calculation of feature importance, and gives insights into the required model complexity to fit the given task. We introduce the general framework and outline its implementation autocompboost. To demonstrate the frameworks efficacy, we compare autocompboost to other existing systems based on the OpenML AutoML-Benchmark. Despite its restriction to an interpretable model space, our system is competitive in terms of predictive performance on most data sets while being more user-friendly and transparent.},

The DHS were initially designed to expand on demographic, fertility and family planning data collected in the World Fertility Surveys and Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys, and continue to provide an important resource for the monitoring of vital statistics and population health indicators in low- and middle-income countries. The DHS collect a wide range of objective and self-reported data with a strong focus on indicators of fertility, reproductive health, maternal and child health, mortality, nutrition and self-reported health behaviours among adults. Key advantages of the DHS include high response rates, national coverage, high quality interviewer training, standardized data collection procedures across countries and consistent content over time, allowing comparability across populations cross-sectionally and over time. Data from DHS facilitate epidemiological research focused on monitoring of prevalence, trends and inequalities. A variety of robust observational data analysis methods have been used, including cross-sectional designs, repeated cross-sectional designs, spatial and multilevel analyses, intra-household designs and cross-comparative analyses. In this profile, we present an overview of the DHS along with an introduction to the potential scope for these data in contributing to the field of micro- and macro-epidemiology. DHS datasets are available for researchers through MEASURE DHS at www.measuredhs.com.},

We aimed to determine the role of armed conflict on the prevalence of childhood malnourishment in The Sudan, and understand the underlying mechanisms using a framework based on the social determinants of health.                                         Methods                                We analysed cross-sectional data from the 2014-Sudan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (                 n                 \,=\,14,081) to compare the prevalence of malnourishment in states undergoing armed conflict and states free of conflict. Four-level multilevel multivariate modelling was conducted to identify the contribution of the social determinants of malnourishment in explaining the role of armed conflict in child health, with conflict status as the central predictor and progressive adjustments for child-, household- and cluster- and state-level predictors.                                                        Results               Armed conflict is strongly associated with greater risk of severe and moderate underweight among children under-5. Adjusting for key social determinants of health reduced the strength of the association between armed conflict and risk of underweight, but there is statistical evidence of association between armed conflict and risk of severe underweight (OR: 1.60, 95\%CI: 1.03–2.49 for the low intensity group).                                         Conclusion               Conflict-exposed children are particularly vulnerable to malnourishment, and this association is mostly explained by key socio-demographic factors. With the prolonged political instability in The Sudan, sustainable nutritional interventions are necessary to ease hard conditions in conflict-exposed states, and also among disadvantaged families in conflict-free regions.},

Unfortunately, the huge costs associated with collecting these data deter more frequent and large-coverage surveys. To address this challenge, we present a scalable and inexpensive end-to-end WASH estimation workflow using a combination of machine learning and census data, publicly available satellite images, and crowd-sourced geospatial information. We generate a map of WASH estimates at a granularity of 250m x 250m across the entire country of Colombia. The model was able to explain up to 65\% of the variation in predicting access to water supply, sewage, and toilets.

The response from each child is a binary indicator of the presence of malarial parasites in a blood sample. The model includes terms for the effects of child level covariates (age and bed net use), village level covariates (inclusion or exclusion from the primary health care system and greenness of surrounding vegetation as derived from satellite information) and separate components for residual spatial and non-spatial extrabinomial variation. The results confirm and quantify the progressive increase in prevalence with age, and the protective effects of bed nets. They also show that the extrabinomial variation is spatially structured, suggesting an environmental effect rather than variation in familial susceptibility. Neither inclusion in the primary health care system nor the greenness of the surrounding vegetation appeared to affect the prevalence of malaria. The method of inference was Bayesian using vague priors and a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation.},

In this article, we first review statistical methods and software associated with this standard model, then consider several methodological extensions whose development has been motivated by the requirements of specific applications. These include: methods for combining randomized survey data with data from nonrandomized, and therefore potentially biased, surveys; spatio-temporal extensions; and spatially structured zero-inflation. Throughout, we illustrate the methods with disease mapping applications that have arisen through our involvement with a range of African public health programs.},

  abstract = {Measles is a significant source of global disease burden and child mortality. Measles vaccination through routine immunization (RI) programs in high-burden settings remains a challenge due to poor health care infrastructure and access. Supplementary immunization activities (SIA) in the form of vaccination campaigns are therefore implemented to prevent measles outbreaks by reducing the size of the susceptible population. The SIA efficacy, defined as the fraction of susceptible population immunized by an SIA, is a critical metric for assessing campaign effectiveness. We propose a discrete-time hidden Markov model for estimating SIA efficacy and forecasting future incidence trends using reported measles incidence data. Our approach extends the time-series susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) framework by adding a model component to capture the impact of SIAs on the susceptible population. It also accounts for under-reporting and its associated uncertainty via a two-stage estimation procedure with uncertainty propagation. The proposed model can be used to estimate the underlying susceptible population dynamics, assess how many susceptible people were immunized by past SIAs, and forecast incidence trends in the future under various hypothetical SIA scenarios. We examine model performance via simulations under various levels of under-reporting, and apply the model to analyze monthly reported measles incidence in Benin from 2012 to 2018.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major burden  to global public health in recent years, and has caused substantial morbidity and mortality. At the onset of the pandemic, handwashing was recognized as critically important to reducing the spread of COVID-19. Most countries implemented initiatives to improve access to handwashing during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected fieldwork in the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, and disrupted data collection in the Rwanda 2019�20 DHS and the India 2019�21 DHS. In this report, we use these unique datasets to explore the change in access to a basic handwashing facility using data collected before fieldwork was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic (pre) and after fieldwork resumed (post). We use a Bayesian geospatial modeling approach to estimate basic handwashing access at the second subnational administrative level (Admin 2), which is called a district in Rwanda and India. To assess the impact of systematic differences, we also compared the wealth and urban/rural distribution between the pre and post samples. We quantified the risk of COVID-19 transmission and mortality at the Admin 2 level by modeling the percentage of overcrowded households and the percentage of households with at least one member age 65 or older as proxy indicators. We evaluated the association between these risk factors and the percentage change in access to basic handwashing from the pre sample to the post sample at the Admin 2 level. The study found that basic handwashing access improved in 10 of the 13 districts evaluated in Rwanda, and 47 of the 49 districts evaluated in India. The average percentage increase in the 10 Rwandan districts was 27.7\%, and the average percentage increase in the 47 Indian districts was 20.5\%. We did not identify any systematic differences in wealth or the proportion of urban clusters between the pre and post samples. We did not identify a significant association between the percentage change in basic handwashing access experienced by districts and the districts� COVID-19 risk, as measured by both the percentage of overcrowded households and the percentage of households with at least one member age 65 or older. Although this study was not designed to assess causative factors for any changes in basic handwashing access, we identified a positive trend in basic handwashing access. Further research and analysis could evaluate this trend and the causative factors underlying any changes in basic handwashing access. The improvement in handwashing has broader implications beyond COVID-19, because handwashing reduces the spread of respiratory and diarrheal diseases. By conducting this study at the policy- relevant Admin 2 level, the COVID-19-related factors modeled in this study could be used by policymakers and program planners to evaluate their COVID-19 response and adapt preventive measures in the future.}

  abstract = {We present Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost), an algorithm for generic probabilistic prediction via gradient boosting. Typical regression models return a point estimate, conditional on covariates, but probabilistic regression models output a full probability distribution over the outcome space, conditional on the covariates. This allows for predictive uncertainty estimation– crucial in applications like healthcare and weather forecasting. NGBoost generalizes gradient boosting to probabilistic regression by treating the parameters of the conditional distribution as targets for a multiparameter boosting algorithm. Furthermore, we show how the Natural Gradient is required to correct the training dynamics of our multiparameter boosting approach. NGBoost can be used with any base learner, any family of distributions with continuous parameters, and any scoring rule. NGBoost matches or exceeds the performance of existing methods for probabilistic prediction while offering additional benefits in flexibility, scalability, and usability. An open-source implementation is available at github.com/stanfordmlgroup/ngboost.}

To design geographically targeted and effective intervention mechanisms of malaria, an up-to-date map that shows the spatial distribution of malaria is needed. This study analyzed 2018 Mozambique Malaria Indicator Survey using geostatistical methods to: i) explore individual, household, and community-level determinants of malaria in under-five children, ii) prepare a malaria prevalence map in Mozambique, and iii) produce prediction prevalence maps and exceedence probability across the country. The results show the overall weighted prevalence of malaria was 38.9\% (N = 4347, with 95\% CI: 36.9\%–40.8\%). Across different provinces of Mozambique, the prevalence of malaria ranges from 1\% in Maputo city to 57.3\% in Cabo Delgado province. Malaria prevalence was found to be higher in rural areas, increased with child’s age, and decreased with household wealth index and mother’s level of education. Given the high prevalence of childhood malaria observed in Mozambique there is an urgent need for effective public health interventions in malaria hot spot areas. The household determinants of malaria infection that are identified in this study as well as the maps of parasitaemia risk could be used by malaria control program implementers to define priority intervention areas.},

Such weights, described as level-weights, are required for multilevel modeling with data from complex surveys that involve multistage sampling, unequal sampling probabilities, and stratification. Like most survey datasets available for public use, level-weights are not included in DHS data because of concerns about disclosure risk. This report develops and illustrates a framework for estimating or approximating level-weights in DHS surveys. The proposed framework requires data that is included in the publicly available DHS datasets and final reports. The same framework can be used to approximate level-weights for other household surveys, such as the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).}

Unfortunately, traditional data sources are often outdated or lacking appropriate disaggregation. As a remedy, satellite imagery has recently become prominent in obtaining geographically-fine-grained and up-to-date poverty estimates. Satellite data can pick up signals of economic activity by detecting light at night, it can pick up development status by detecting infrastructure such as roads, and it can pick up signals for individual household wealth by detecting different building footprints and roof types. It can, however, not look inside the households and pick up signals from individuals. On the other hand, alternative data sources such as audience estimates from Facebook’s advertising platform provide insights into the devices and internet connection types used by individuals in different locations. Previous work has shown the value of such anonymous, publicly-accessible advertising data from Facebook for studying migration, gender gaps, crime rates, and health, among others. In this work, we evaluate the added value of using Facebook data over satellite data for mapping socioeconomic development in two low and middle income countries – the Philippines and India. We show that Facebook features perform roughly similar to satellite data in the Philippines with value added for urban locations. In India, however, where Facebook penetration is lower, satellite data perform better.}

  abstract = {This report examines the relationship between two different diagnostic tests used in nationally-representative household surveys to measure malaria parasitemia prevalence: Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) and microscopy. Prevalence estimates from 22 surveys containing both microscopy and RDT results were compared using tests of agreement, and factors that could be influencing discordance between the two tests were identified. Although prevalence estimates from the two tests were highly correlated, RDT prevalence estimates were higher than microscopy prevalence estimates in 19 of 22 surveys examined. Given the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test for malaria that is practical for use in national survey settings, discrepancies in prevalence estimates generated from microscopy testing and from RDT testing are difficult to reconcile. Although results of these tests could be useful in identification of high-risk populations for targeting of interventions, assessments of impact based on changes in malaria prevalence measured with these tests are more problematic. Development of an algorithm for program managers to use to best estimate national prevalence given the available diagnostic data would be useful for the future.}

  abstract = {The emerging need for subnational estimation of demographic and health indicators in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is driving a move from design-based area-level approaches to unit-level methods. The latter are model-based and overcome data sparsity by borrowing strength across covariates and space and can, in principle, be leveraged to create fine-scale pixel level maps based on household surveys. However, typical implementations of the model-based approaches do not fully acknowledge the complex survey design, and do not enjoy the theoretical consistency of design-based approaches. We describe how spatial methods are currently used for prevalence mapping in the context of LMICs, highlight the key challenges that need to be overcome, and propose a new approach, which is methodologically closer in spirit to small area estimation. The main discussion points are demonstrated through a case study of vaccination coverage in Nigeria based on 2018 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data. We discuss our key findings both generally and with an emphasis on the implications for popular approaches undertaken by industrial producers of subnational prevalence estimates.},

  abstract = {Anaemia and stunting remain jointly a serious health issue worldwide especially in developing countries. In Lesotho, their prevalence is high, particularly among children less than 5 years of age. The primary objective was to determine the association between anaemia and stunting, and identify factors relating to both conditions among children younger than 5 years in Lesotho. This cross-sectional study used secondary data from 3112 children collected during the 2014 Lesotho Demographic Health Survey (LDHS). Haemoglobin (Hb) levels were adjusted for altitude and a level less than 11 g per deciliters (11 g/dl) was determined as the cutoff for being anaemic. A child with the height-for-age z score (HAZ) below minus two standard deviations (SD) was considered to have stunting. We linked factors relating to anaemia and stunting using a multivariate joint model under the scope of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The prevalence of anaemia and stunting in children younger than 5 years were 51\% and 43\% respectively. The multivariate results revealed a strong association between anaemia and stunting. In addition, maternal education, urban vs. rural residence, wealth index and childbirth weight significantly impacted childhood stunting or malnutrition, while having fever and/or diarrhoea was linked to anaemia. Lastly, age was shown to have a significant effect on both stunting and anaemia. Anaemia and stunting or malnutrition showed linked longitudinal trajectories, suggesting both conditions could lead to synergetic improvements in overall child health. Demographic, socio-economic, and geographical characteristics were also important drivers of stunting and anaemia in children younger than 5 years. Thus, children living in similar resources settings as Lesotho could benefit from coordinated programs designed to address both malnutrition and anaemia.},

Our model works by discovering associations between cars and people. For example, if the number of sedans in a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, that city is likely to vote for a Democrat in the next presidential election (88\% chance); if not, then the city is likely to vote for a Republican (82\% chance).            ,               The United States spends more than \$250 million each year on the American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation, unemployment, and other demographic factors. Although a comprehensive source of data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can exceed several years. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision techniques improve, automated data analysis may become an increasingly practical supplement to the ACS. Here, we present a method that estimates socioeconomic characteristics of regions spanning 200 US cities by using 50 million images of street scenes gathered with Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques, we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22 million automobiles in total (8\% of all automobiles in the United States), were used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns at the zip code and precinct level. (The average US precinct contains ∼1,000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next presidential election (88\% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82\%). Our results suggest that automated systems for monitoring demographics may effectively complement labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to measure demographics with fine spatial resolution, in close to real time.},

We illustrate the different stages of the analysis, from exploratory analysis to spatial prediction of prevalence, through a case study on malaria mapping in Tanzania. Throughout the paper, we distinguish between predictive modelling, whose main focus is on maximizing the predictive accuracy of the model, and explanatory modelling, where greater emphasis is placed on understanding the relationships between the health outcome and risk factors. We demonstrate that these two paradigms can result in different modelling choices. We also propose a simple approach for detecting over-fitting based on inspection of the correlation matrix of the estimators of the regression coefficients. To enhance the interpretability of geostatistical models, we introduce the concept of domain effects in order to assist variable selection and model validation. The statistical ideas and principles illustrated here in the specific context of disease prevalence mapping are more widely applicable to any regression model for the analysis of epidemiological outcomes but are particularly relevant to geostatistical models, for which the separation between fixed and random effects can be ambiguous.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Acute malnutrition affects a sizeable number of young children around the world, with serious repercussions for mortality and morbidity. Among the top priorities in addressing this problem are to anticipate which children tend to be susceptible and where and when crises of high prevalence rates would be likely to arise. In this article, we highlight the potential role of conflict and climate conditions as risk factors for acute malnutrition, while also assessing other vulnerabilities at the individual- and household-levels. Existing research reflects these features selectively, whereas we incorporate all the features into the same study. The empirical analysis relies on integration of health, conflict, and environmental data at multiple scales of observation to focuses on how local conflict and climate factors relate to an individual child’s health. The centerpiece of the analysis is data from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in several different cross-sectional waves covering 2003–2016 in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. The results obtained from multi-level statistical models indicate that in Kenya and Nigeria, conflict is associated with lower weight-for-height scores among children, even after accounting for individual-level and climate factors. In Nigeria and Kenya, conflict lagged 1–3~months and occurring within the growing season tends to reduce WHZ scores. In Uganda, however, weight-for-height scores are primarily associated with individual-level and household-level conditions and demonstrate little association with conflict or climate factors. The findings are valuable to guide humanitarian policymakers and practitioners in effective and efficient targeting of attention, interventions, and resources that lessen burdens of acute malnutrition in countries prone to conflict and climate shocks.},

  abstract = {Educational attainment for women of reproductive age is linked to reduced child and maternal mortality, lower fertility and improved reproductive health. Comparable analyses of attainment exist only at the national level, potentially obscuring patterns in subnational inequality. Evidence suggests that wide disparities between urban and rural populations exist, raising questions about where the majority of progress towards the education targets of the Sustainable Development Goals is occurring in African countries. Here we explore within-country inequalities by predicting years of schooling across five by five kilometre grids, generating estimates of average educational attainment by age and sex at subnational levels. Despite marked progress in attainment from 2000 to 2015 across Africa, substantial differences persist between locations and sexes. These differences have widened in many countries, particularly across the Sahel. These high-resolution, comparable estimates improve the ability of decision-makers to plan the precisely targeted interventions that will be necessary to deliver progress during the era of the Sustainable Development Goals.},

Current boosting approaches also offer methods accounting for random effects and thus enable prediction of mixed models for longitudinal and clustered data. However, these approaches include several flaws resulting in unbalanced effect selection with falsely induced shrinkage and a low convergence rate on the one hand and biased estimates of the random effects on the other hand. We therefore propose a new boosting algorithm which explicitly accounts for the random structure by excluding it from the selection procedure, properly correcting the random effects estimates and in addition providing likelihood-based estimation of the random effects variance structure. The new algorithm offers an organic and unbiased fitting approach, which is shown via simulations and data examples.},

  abstract = {Joint models are a powerful class of statistical models which apply to any data where event times are recorded alongside a longitudinal outcome by connecting longitudinal and time-to-event data within a joint likelihood allowing for quantification of the association between the two outcomes without possible bias. In order to make joint models feasible for regularization and variable selection, a statistical boosting algorithm has been proposed, which fits joint models using component-wise gradient boosting techniques. However, these methods have well-known limitations, i.e., they provide no balanced updating procedure for random effects in longitudinal analysis and tend to return biased effect estimation for time-dependent covariates in survival analysis. In this manuscript, we adapt likelihood-based boosting techniques to the framework of joint models and propose a novel algorithm in order to improve inference where gradient boosting has said limitations. The algorithm represents a novel boosting approach allowing for time-dependent covariates in survival analysis and in addition offers variable selection for joint models, which is evaluated via simulations and real world application modelling CD4 cell counts of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, the method stands out with respect to variable selection properties and represents an accessible way to boosting for time-dependent covariates in survival analysis, which lays a foundation for all kinds of possible extensions.},

The aesthetic conception emphasizes a theory's elegance and clarity; the ontological conception, drawing upon the hard sciences, posits that the world is governed by simple fundamental laws. Neither applies in international relations theory or to social science more broadly. Instead, only the epistemological conception—abstracting from reality to highlight recurring patterns and build testable propositions—justifies parsimony. This view is not a naive simplification of the world but a self-conscious capitulation to its complexity. Though both critics and supporters of parsimony often do not distinguish among these three “visions,” doing so has important implications for how we think about evaluating theories.},

Less well understood are the implications of these contractions for child acute malnutrition (wasting), a major risk factor for under-5 mortality. This study explores the nutritional impacts of economic growth shocks over 1990–2018 by linking wasting outcomes collected for 1.256 million children from 52 countries to lagged annual changes in economic growth. Estimates suggest that a 10\% annual decline in national income increases moderate/severe wasting prevalence by 14.4–17.8\%. An exploration of possible mechanisms suggests negative economic shocks may increase risks of inadequate dietary diversity among children. Applying these results to the latest economic growth estimates for 2020 suggests that COVID-19 could put an additional 9.4 million preschoolers at risk of wasting, net of the effects of preventative policy actions.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting monthly deseasonalized land temperature at different locations worldwide based on sea surface temperature (SST). Contrary to popular belief on the trade-off between (a) simple interpretable but inaccurate models and (b) complex accurate but uninterpretable models, we introduce a weighted Lasso model for the problem which yields interpretable results while being highly accurate. Covariate weights in the regularization of weighted Lasso are pre-determined, and proportional to the spatial distance of the covariate (sea surface location) from the target (land location). We establish finite sample estimation error bounds for weighted Lasso, and illustrate its superior empirical performance and interpretability over complex models such as deep neural networks (Deep nets) and gradient boosted trees (GBT). We also present a detailed empirical analysis of what went wrong with Deep nets here, which may serve as a helpful guideline for application of Deep nets to small sample scientific problems.},

A special focus lies on algorithms that incorporate automatic variable selection like the least absolute shrinkage operator (lasso) or statistical boosting techniques. Objectives: Focusing on the linear regression framework, this article compares the two most-common techniques for this task, the lasso and gradient boosting, both from a methodological and a practical perspective. Methods: We describe these methods highlighting under which circumstances their results will coincide in low-dimensional settings. In addition, we carry out extensive simulation studies comparing the performance in settings with more predictors than observations and investigate multiple combinations of noise-to-signal ratio and number of true non-zero coeffcients. Finally, we examine the impact of different tuning methods on the results. Results: Both methods carry out penalization and variable selection for possibly highdimensional data, often resulting in very similar models. An advantage of the lasso is its faster run-time, a strength of the boosting concept is its modular nature, making it easy to extend to other regression settings. Conclusions: Although following different strategies with respect to optimization and regularization, both methods imply similar constraints to the estimation problem leading to a comparable performance regarding prediction accuracy and variable selection in practice.},

Geographic access to healthcare can be modeled using spatial datasets on local context, together with the distribution of existing health facilities and populations. Several population datasets are currently available, but their impact on accessibility analyses is unknown. In this study, we model the geographic accessibility of public health facilities at 100-meter resolution in sub-Saharan Africa and evaluate six of the most popular gridded population datasets for their impact on coverage statistics at different administrative levels.                                         Methods               Travel time to nearest health facilities was calculated by overlaying health facility coordinates on top of a friction raster accounting for roads, landcover, and physical barriers. We then intersected six different gridded population datasets with our travel time estimates to determine accessibility coverages within various travel time thresholds (i.e., 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180-min).                                         Results               Here we show that differences in accessibility coverage can exceed 70\% at the sub-national level, based on a one-hour travel time threshold. The differences are most notable in large and sparsely populated administrative units and dramatically shape patterns of healthcare accessibility at national and sub-national levels.                                         Conclusions               The results of this study show how valuable and critical a comparative analysis between population datasets is for the derivation of coverage statistics that inform local policies and monitor global targets. Large differences exist between the datasets and the results underscore an essential source of uncertainty in accessibility analyses that should be systematically assessed.},

  abstract = {Generalized additive models (GAMs) play an important role in modeling and understanding complex relationships in modern applied statistics. They allow for flexible, data-driven estimation of covariate effects. Yet researchers often have a priori knowledge of certain effects, which might be monotonic or periodic (cyclic) or should fulfill boundary conditions. We propose a unified framework to incorporate these constraints for both univariate and bivariate effect estimates and for varying coefficients. As the framework is based on component-wise boosting methods, variables can be selected intrinsically, and effects can be estimated for a wide range of different distributional assumptions. Bootstrap confidence intervals for the effect estimates are derived to assess the models. We present three case studies from environmental sciences to illustrate the proposed seamless modeling framework. All discussed constrained effect estimates are implemented in the comprehensive R package mboost for model-based boosting.},

Digital data provide granular information on time and space, but do not draw from representative samples of the population, leading to biased estimates. We propose a method for combining digital data and official statistics by using the official statistics to model the spatial and temporal dependence structure of the biases of digital data. We use simulations to demonstrate the validity of the model, then empirically illustrate our approach by combining geo-located Twitter data with data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to estimate state-level out-migration probabilities in the United States. We show that our model, which combines unbiased and biased data, produces predictions that are more accurate than predictions based solely on unbiased data. Our approach demonstrates how digital data can be used to complement, rather than replace, official statistics.},

  abstract = {Recent arguments that machine learning (ML) is facing a reproducibility and replication crisis suggest that some published claims in ML research cannot be taken at face value. These concerns inspire analogies to the replication crisis affecting the social and medical sciences. They also inspire calls for the integration of statistical approaches to causal inference and predictive modeling. A deeper understanding of what reproducibility concerns in supervised ML research have in common with the replication crisis in experimental science puts the new concerns in perspective, and helps researchers avoid "the worst of both worlds," where ML researchers begin borrowing methodologies from explanatory modeling without understanding their limitations and vice versa. We contribute a comparative analysis of concerns about inductive learning that arise in causal attribution as exemplified in psychology versus predictive modeling as exemplified in ML. We identify themes that re-occur in reform discussions, like overreliance on asymptotic theory and non-credible beliefs about real-world data generating processes. We argue that in both fields, claims from learning are implied to generalize outside the specific environment studied (e.g., the input dataset or subject sample, modeling implementation, etc.) but are often impossible to refute due to undisclosed sources of variance in the learning pipeline. In particular, errors being acknowledged in ML expose cracks in long-held beliefs that optimizing predictive accuracy using huge datasets absolves one from having to consider a true data generating process or formally represent uncertainty in performance claims. We conclude by discussing risks that arise when sources of errors are misdiagnosed and the need to acknowledge the role of human inductive biases in learning and reform.},

The objective of AReNA is to close important knowledge gaps on the links between nutrition and agriculture, with a particular focus on conducting policy-relevant research at scale and crowding in more research on this issue by creating data sets and analytical tools that can benefit the broader research community. Much of the research on agriculture and nutrition is hindered by a lack of data, and many of the datasets that do contain both agriculture and nutrition information are often small in size and geographic scope. AReNA team constructed a large multi-level, multi-country dataset combining nutrition and nutrition-relevant information at the individual and household level from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) with a wide variety of geo-referenced data on agricultural production, agroecology, climate, demography, and infrastructure (GIS data). This dataset includes 60 countries, 184 DHS, and 122,473 clusters. Over one thousand geospatial variables are linked with DHS. The entire dataset is organized into 13 individual files: DHS\_distance, DHS\_livestock, DHS\_main, DHS\_malaria, DHS NDVI, DHS\_nightlight, DHS\_pasture and climate (mean), DHS\_rainfall, DHS\_soil, DHS\_SPAM, DHS\_suit, DHS\_temperature, and DHS\_traveltime.},

Jean               et al.               combined nighttime maps with high-resolution daytime satellite images (see the Perspective by Blumenstock). With a bit of machine-learning wizardry, the combined images can be converted into accurate estimates of household consumption and assets, both of which are hard to measure in poorer countries. Furthermore, the night- and day-time data are publicly available and nonproprietary.

Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African countries—Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda—we show how a convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can explain up to 75\% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning (ML) methods for prediction and forecasting has become widespread across the quantitative sciences. However, there are many known methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. In this paper, we systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based science. We show that data leakage is indeed a widespread problem and has led to severe reproducibility failures. Specifically, through a survey of literature in research communities that adopted ML methods, we find 17 fields where errors have been found, collectively affecting 329 papers and in some cases leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we present a fine-grained taxonomy of 8 types of leakage that range from textbook errors to open research problems. We argue for fundamental methodological changes to ML-based science so that cases of leakage can be caught before publication. To that end, we propose model info sheets for reporting scientific claims based on ML models that would address all types of leakage identified in our survey. To investigate the impact of reproducibility errors and the efficacy of model info sheets, we undertake a reproducibility study in a field where complex ML models are believed to vastly outperform older statistical models such as Logistic Regression (LR): civil war prediction. We find that all papers claiming the superior performance of complex ML models compared to LR models fail to reproduce due to data leakage, and complex ML models don't perform substantively better than decades-old LR models. While none of these errors could have been caught by reading the papers, model info sheets would enable the detection of leakage in each case.},

  abstract = {Understanding the biases in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based algorithms is gaining paramount importance due to its increased applications on many real-world problems. A known problem of DNN penalizing the underrepresented population could undermine the efficacy of development projects dependent on data produced using DNN-based models. In spite of this, the problems of biases in DNN for Land Use and Land Cover Classification (LULCC) have not been a subject of many studies. In this study, we explore ways to quantify biases in DNN for land use with an example of identifying school buildings in Colombia from satellite imagery. We implement a DNN-based model by fine-tuning an existing, pre-trained model for school building identification. The model achieved overall 84\% accuracy. Then, we used socioeconomic covariates to analyze possible biases in the learned representation. The retrained deep neural network was used to extract visual features (embeddings) from satellite image tiles. The embeddings were clustered into four subtypes of schools, and the accuracy of the neural network model was assessed for each cluster. The distributions of various socioeconomic covariates by clusters were analyzed to identify the links between the model accuracy and the aforementioned covariates. Our results indicate that the model accuracy is lowest (57\%) where the characteristics of the landscape are predominantly related to poverty and remoteness, which confirms our original assumption on the heterogeneous performances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and their biases. Based on our findings, we identify possible sources of bias and present suggestions on how to prepare a balanced training dataset that would result in less biased AI algorithms. The framework used in our study to better understand biases in DNN models would be useful when Machine Learning (ML) techniques are adopted in lieu of ground-based data collection for international development programs. Because such programs aim to solve issues of social inequality, MLs are only applicable when they are transparent and accountable.},

  abstract = {Spatial weight matrices play a key role in econometrics to capture spatial effects. However, these constructs are prone to clustering and can be challenging to analyse in common statistical packages such as STATA. Multiple observations of survey participants in the same location (or cluster) have traditionally not been dealt with appropriately by statistical packages. It is common that participants are assigned Geographic Information System (GIS) data at a regional or district level rather than at a small area level. For example, the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) generates GIS data at a cluster level, such as a regional or district level, rather than providing coordinates for each participant. Moreover, current statistical packages are not suitable for estimating large matrices such as 20,000\,×\,20,000 (reflective of data within large health surveys) since the statistical package limits the N to a smaller number. In addition, in many cases, GIS information is offered at an aggregated level of geographical areas. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a bootstrap approach that generates an inverse distance spatial weight matrix for application in econometric analyses of health survey data. The new approach is illustrated using DHS data on uptake of HIV testing in low and middle income countries.},

  abstract = {Significance              To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prediction of child anthropometric failure estimates for 597,121 villages—the smallest local governance unit—in India. While prior child nutrition policies and programs in India focused on districts for planning, implementation, and monitoring, we highlight that a majority of the geographic variation in child anthropometric failures occur at the micro geographic level of villages followed by the macro administrative level of states. Precision mapping of health data at the village level can enable more informed and effective local politics in India.            ,               There are emerging opportunities to assess health indicators at truly small areas with increasing availability of data geocoded to micro geographic units and advanced modeling techniques. The utility of such fine-grained data can be fully leveraged if linked to local governance units that are accountable for implementation of programs and interventions. We used data from the 2011 Indian Census for village-level demographic and amenities features and the 2016 Indian Demographic and Health Survey in a bias-corrected semisupervised regression framework to predict child anthropometric failures for all villages in India. Of the total geographic variation in predicted child anthropometric failure estimates, 54.2 to 72.3\% were attributed to the village level followed by 20.6 to 39.5\% to the state level. The mean predicted stunting was 37.9\% (SD: 10.1\%; IQR: 31.2 to 44.7\%), and substantial variation was found across villages ranging from less than 5\% for 691 villages to over 70\% in 453 villages. Estimates at the village level can potentially shift the paradigm of policy discussion in India by enabling more informed prioritization and precise targeting. The proposed methodology can be adapted and applied to diverse population health indicators, and in other contexts, to reveal spatial heterogeneity at a finer geographic scale and identify local areas with the greatest needs and with direct implications for actions to take place.},

  abstract = {Childhood malnutrition is associated with high morbidity and mortality globally1. Undernourished children are more likely to experience cognitive, physical, and metabolic developmental impairments that can lead to later cardiovascular disease, reduced intellectual ability and school attainment, and reduced economic productivity in adulthood2. Child growth failure (CGF), expressed as stunting, wasting, and underweight in children under five~years of age (0–59~months), is a specific subset of undernutrition characterized by insufficient height or weight against age-specific growth reference standards3–5. The prevalence of stunting, wasting, or underweight in children under five is the proportion of children with a height-for-age, weight-for-height, or weight-for-age z-score, respectively, that is more than two standard deviations below the World Health Organization’s median growth reference standards for a healthy population6. Subnational estimates of CGF report substantial heterogeneity within countries, but are available primarily at the first administrative level (for example, states or provinces)7; the uneven geographical distribution of CGF has motivated further calls for assessments that can match the local scale of many public health programmes8. Building from our previous work mapping CGF in Africa9, here we provide the first, to our knowledge, mapped high-spatial-resolution estimates of CGF indicators from 2000 to 2017 across 105 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 99\% of affected children live1, aggregated to policy-relevant first and second (for example, districts or counties) administrative-level units and national levels. Despite remarkable declines over the study period, many LMICs remain far from the ambitious World Health Organization Global Nutrition Targets to reduce stunting by 40\% and wasting to less than 5\% by 2025. Large disparities in prevalence and progress exist across and within countries; our maps identify high-prevalence areas even within nations otherwise succeeding in reducing overall CGF prevalence. By highlighting where the highest-need populations reside, these geospatial estimates can support policy-makers in planning interventions that are adapted locally and in efficiently directing resources towards reducing CGF and its health implications.},

We report on a largescale experiment–over half a million runs of C4.5 and a Naive-Bayes algorithm–to estimate the effects of different parameters on these algrithms on real-world datasets. For crossvalidation we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are stratified or not, for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples. Our results indicate that for real-word datasets similar to ours, The best method to use for model selection is ten fold stratified cross validation even if computation power allows using more folds.},

  abstract = {Humanitarian mapping from space with machine learning helps policy-makers to timely and accurately identify people in need. However, recent concerns around fairness and transparency of algorithmic decision-making are a significant obstacle for applying these methods in practice. In this paper, we study if humanitarian mapping approaches from space are prone to bias in their predictions. We map village-level poverty and electricity rates in India based on nighttime lights (NTLs) with linear regression and random forest and analyze if the predictions systematically show prejudice against scheduled caste or tribe communities. To achieve this, we design a causal approach to measure counterfactual fairness based on propensity score matching. This allows to compare villages within a community of interest to synthetic counterfactuals. Our findings indicate that poverty is systematically overestimated and electricity systematically underestimated for scheduled tribes in comparison to a synthetic counterfactual group of villages. The effects have the opposite direction for scheduled castes where poverty is underestimated and electrification overestimated. These results are a warning sign for a variety of applications in humanitarian mapping where fairness issues would compromise policy goals.},

It employs standard statistical learning techniques---cross-validation and parameter regularization---which together reduce the extent to which the model is over-fitted to match the idiosyncracies of observed survey data. The automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this development setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which limits the costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic is needed to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immediately after data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the model (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that may be characterized by significant sub-national differences. Using survey data from Zambia, the model's out-of-sample predictions distinguish poor households from non-poor households using information contained in ten questions.},

In this paper, we provide results for valid inference after post- or orthogonal L2-boosting is used for variable selection. We consider treatment effects after selecting among many control variables and instrumental variable models with potentially many instruments. To achieve this, we establish new results for the rate of convergence of iterated post-L2-boosting and orthogonal L2-boosting in a high-dimensional setting similar to Lasso, i.e., under approximate sparsity without assuming the beta-min condition. These results are extended to the 2SLS framework and valid inference is provided for treatment effect analysis. We give extensive simulation results for the proposed methods and compare them with Lasso. In an empirical application, we construct efficient IVs with our proposed methods to estimate the effect of pre-merger overlap of bank branch networks in the US on the post-merger stock returns of the acquirer bank.},

  abstract = {Machine learning can impact people with legal or ethical consequences when it is used to automate decisions in areas such as insurance, lending, hiring, and predictive policing. In many of these scenarios, previous decisions have been made that are unfairly biased against certain subpopulations, for example those of a particular race, gender, or sexual orientation. Since this past data may be biased, machine learning predictors must account for this to avoid perpetuating or creating discriminatory practices. In this paper, we develop a framework for modeling fairness using tools from causal inference. Our definition of counterfactual fairness captures the intuition that a decision is fair towards an individual if it is the same in (a) the actual world and (b) a counterfactual world where the individual belonged to a different demographic group. We demonstrate our framework on a real-world problem of fair prediction of success in law school.},

  abstract = {Certain subpopulations like female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), and people who inject drugs (PWID) often have higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS and are difficult to map directly due to stigma, discrimination, and criminalization. Fine-scale mapping of those populations contributes to the progress toward reducing the inequalities and ending the AIDS epidemic. In 2016 and 2017, the PLACE surveys were conducted at 3290 venues in 20 out of the total 28 districts in Malawi to estimate the FSW sizes. These venues represent a presence-only dataset where, instead of knowing both where people live and do not live (presence–absence data), only information about visited locations is available. In this study, we develop a Bayesian model for presence-only data and utilize the PLACE data to estimate the FSW size and uncertainty interval at a 1.5×1.5-km resolution for all of Malawi. The estimates can also be aggregated to any desirable level (city/district/region) for implementing targeted HIV prevention and treatment programs in FSW communities, which have been successful in lowering the incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

We want models to be not only good, but interpretable. And yet the task of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of different notions, and question the oft-made assertions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.},

The open source R package SUMMER implements a variety of methods for spatial or spatio-temporal smoothing of survey data. The emphasis is on small-area estimation. We focus primarily on indicators in a low and middle-income countries context. Our methods are particularly useful for data from Demographic Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. We build upon functions within the survey package, and use INLA for fast Bayesian computation.

Reliable routine surveillance data of malaria incidence, typically aggregated to administrative units, is becoming more widely available. Disaggregation regression is an important model framework for estimating high resolution risk maps from aggregated data. However, the aggregation of incidence over large, heterogeneous areas means that these data are underpowered for estimating complex, non-linear models. In contrast, prevalence point-surveys are directly linked to local environmental conditions but are not common in many areas of the world. Here, we train multiple non-linear, machine learning models on Plasmodium falciparum prevalence point-surveys. We then ensemble the predictions from these machine learning models with a disaggregation regression model that uses aggregated malaria incidences as response data. We find that using a disaggregation regression model to combine predictions from machine learning models improves model accuracy relative to a baseline model.},

  abstract = {As malaria incidence decreases and more countries move towards elimination, maps of malaria risk in low-prevalence areas are increasingly needed. For low-burden areas, disaggregation regression models have been developed to estimate risk at high spatial resolution from routine surveillance reports aggregated by administrative unit polygons. However, in areas with both routine surveillance data and prevalence surveys, models that make use of the spatial information from prevalence point-surveys might make more accurate predictions. Using case studies in Indonesia, Senegal and Madagascar, we compare the out-of-sample mean absolute error for two methods for incorporating point-level, spatial information into disaggregation regression models. The first simply fits a binomial-likelihood, logit-link, Gaussian random field to prevalence point-surveys to create a new covariate. The second is a multi-likelihood model that is fitted jointly to prevalence point-surveys and polygon incidence data. We find that in most cases there is no difference in mean absolute error between models. In only one case, did the new models perform the best. More generally, our results demonstrate that combining these types of data has the potential to reduce absolute error in estimates of malaria incidence but that simpler baseline models should always be fitted as a benchmark.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Lack of regular physical or economic access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food is a critical issue affecting millions of people world-wide. Estimating how many and where these people are is of fundamental importance for governments and humanitarian organizations to take informed and timely decisions on relevant policies and programmes. In this study, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption and of people using crisis or above crisis food-based coping when primary data is not available. Making use of a unique global data set, we show that the proposed models can explain up to 78\% of the variation in insufficient food consumption and crisis or above food-based coping levels. We also show that the proposed models can be used to nowcast the food security situation in near-real time and propose a method to identify which variables are driving the changes observed in predicted trends, which is key to make predictions serviceable to decision makers.},

  abstract = {Summary             Objectives: Component-wise boosting algorithms have evolved into a popular estimation scheme in biomedical regression settings. The iteration number of these algorithms is the most important tuning parameter to optimize their performance. To date, no fully automated strategy for determining the optimal stopping iteration of boosting algorithms has been proposed.             Methods: We propose a fully data-driven sequential stopping rule for boosting algorithms. It combines resampling methods with a modified version of an earlier stopping approach that depends on AIC-based information criteria. The new “subsampling after AIC” stopping rule is applied to component-wise gradient boosting algorithms.             Results: The newly developed sequential stopping rule outperformed earlier approaches if applied to both simulated and real data. Specifically, it improved purely AIC-based methods when used for the microarray-based prediction of the recurrence of meta-stases for stage II colon cancer patients.             Conclusions: The proposed sequential stopping rule for boosting algorithms can help to identify the optimal stopping iteration already during the fitting process of the algorithm, at least for the most common loss functions.},

However, implementing explicit spatial trends into these algorithms has proven problematic. Using x and y coordinates as covariates gives orthogonal artifacts in the maps, and alternative methods using distances as covariates can be inflexible and difficult to interpret. We propose instead the use of coordinates along several axes tilted at oblique angles to provide an easily interpretable method for obtaining a realistic prediction surface. We test the method on four spatial datasets and compare it to similar methods. The results show that the method provides accuracies better than or on par with the most reliable alternative methods, namely kriging and distance-based covariates. Furthermore, the proposed method is highly flexible, scalable and easily interpretable. This makes it a promising tool for mapping soil properties with complex spatial variation.},

  abstract = {Machines are increasingly doing “intelligent” things. Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.},

  abstract = {Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is considered a public health and human rights concern, mainly concentrated in Africa, and has been targeted for elimination under the sustainable development goals. Interventions aimed at ending the practice often rely on data from household surveys which employ complex designs leading to outcomes that are not totally independent, thus requiring advanced statistical techniques. Combining data from multiple surveys within robust statistical framework holds promise to provide more precise estimates due to increased sample size, and accurately identify ‘hotspots’ and allow for assessment of changes over time. In this study, rich datasets from six (6) successive waves of the Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys undertaken between 2003 and 2016/17, were combined and analyzed in order to better assess changes in the likelihood and prevalence of FGM/C among 0-14-year old girls in Nigeria. We used Bayesian hierarchical regression models which explicitly accounted for the inherent spatial and temporal autocorrelations within the data while simultaneously adjusting for variations due to different survey methods and the effects of linear and non-linear covariates. Parameters were estimated using Markov chain Mote Carlo techniques and model fit assessments were based on Deviance Information Criterion. Results show that prevalence of FGM/C among 0–14 years old girls in Nigeria varied over time and across geographical locations and peaked in 2008 with a shift from South to North. A girl was more likely to be cut if her mother was cut, supported FGM/C continuation, or had no higher education. The effects of mother’s age, wealth and type of residence (urban-rural) were no longer significant in 2016. These results reflect the gains of interventions over the years, but also echo the belief that FGM/C is a social norm thus requiring tailored all-inclusive interventions for the total abandonment of FGM/C in Nigeria.},

Between 2000 and 2015, nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight, the core components of child growth failure. Here we show that striking subnational heterogeneity in levels and trends of child growth remains. If current rates of progress are sustained, many areas of Africa will meet the World Health Organization Global Targets 2025 to improve maternal, infant and young child nutrition, but high levels of growth failure will persist across the Sahel. At these rates, much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target—to end malnutrition by 2030. Geospatial estimates of child growth failure provide a baseline for measuring progress as well as a precision public health platform to target interventions to those populations with the greatest need, in order to reduce health disparities and accelerate progress.},

Many of these studies present fine-scale pixel-level maps in an attempt to answer the needs of the current era of precision public health. However, even though household surveys with a two-stage cluster design stratified by region and urbanicity are a major source of data, cavalier approaches are taken to acknowledging the survey design. We investigate the extent to which accounting for the sample design affects the predictive performance at the aggregate level of interest for health policy decisions. We consider various commonly used models and introduce a new Bayesian cluster-level model with a discrete spatial smoothing prior. The investigation is performed through a simulation study in which realistic sampling frames are created for Kenya, based on the population and demographic information, with a survey design that mimics a Demographic Health Survey (DHS). We find that including stratification and cluster-level random effects can improve predictive performance. Spatially smoothed direct (weighted) estimates and area-level models accounting for stratification were robust to the underlying population and survey design. Continuous spatial models showed some promise in the presence of fine-scale variation; however, these models require the most “hand holding.” Subsequently, we examine how the models perform on real data, estimating the prevalence of secondary education for women aged 20–29 and neonatal mortality rates, using data from the 2014 Kenya DHS.},

  abstract = {Somalia is highly data-deprived, leaving policy makers to operate in a statistical vacuum. To             overcome this challenge, the World Bank implemented wave 2             of the Somali High Frequency Survey to better understand             livelihoods and vulnerabilities and, especially, to estimate             national poverty indicators. The specific context of             insecurity and lack of statistical infrastructure in Somalia             posed several challenges for implementing a household survey             and measuring poverty. This paper outlines how these             challenges were overcome in wave 2 of the Somali High             Frequency Survey through methodological and technological             adaptations in four areas. First, in the absence of a recent             census, no exhaustive lists of census enumeration areas             along with population estimates existed, creating challenges             to derive a probability-based representative sample.             Therefore, geospatial techniques and high-resolution imagery             were used to model the spatial population distribution,             build a probability-based population sampling frame, and             generate enumeration areas to overcome the lack of a recent             population census. Second, although some areas remained             completely inaccessible due to insecurity, even most             accessible areas held potential risks to the safety of field             staff and survey respondents, so that time spent in these             areas had to be minimized. To address security concerns, the             survey adapted logistical arrangements, sampling strategy             using micro-listing, and questionnaire design to limit time             on the ground based on the Rapid Consumption Methodology.             Third, poverty in completely inaccessible areas had to be             estimated by other means. Therefore, the Somali High             Frequency Survey relies on correlates derived from satellite             imagery and other geo-spatial data to estimate poverty in             such areas. Finally, the nonstationary nature of the nomadic             population required special sampling strategies.},

This paper uses             micro-data from two waves of the Somali High Frequency             Survey to assess the impact of the severe drought that             Somalia experienced in 2016/17 on poverty, hunger, and             consumption. The analysis uses a regression framework to             quantify the effects of the drought, relying on spatial             variation in drought exposure and the timing of data             collection, which took place before and during the drought,             for identification. The drought is found to have a sizable             effect on poverty, consumption, and hunger in rural areas,             where agricultural households and those lacking access to             infrastructure and basic services are most severely             affected. A renewed drought shock could lead to an increase             in poverty of 9 percentage points. The findings underscore             the importance of investing in rural resilience, especially among agricultural households.},

  abstract = {The age group composition of populations varies substantially across continents and within countries, and is linked to levels of development, health status and poverty. The subnational variability in the shape of the population pyramid as well as the respective dependency ratio are reflective of the different levels of development of a country and are drivers for a country’s economic prospects and health burdens. Whether measured as the ratio between those of working age and those young and old who are dependent upon them, or through separate young and old-age metrics, dependency ratios are often highly heterogeneous between and within countries. Assessments of subnational dependency ratio and age structure patterns have been undertaken for specific countries and across high income regions, but to a lesser extent across the low income regions. In the framework of the WorldPop Project, through the assembly of over 100 million records across 6,389 subnational administrative units, subnational dependency ratio and high resolution gridded age/sex group datasets were produced for 87 countries in Africa and Asia.}

  abstract = {Significance             The World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change propose undernutrition as the most significant impact of climate change on child health. The question then arises: Where does the empirical evidence to back this claim come from? Current evidence for the impacts of climate on childhood undernutrition draws on a limited number of heterogeneous studies with methodological limitations and is based predominantly on secondary data. Establishing and validating causal pathways among complex confounding factors remain the main challenge in quantifying the climate-attributable fraction of undernutrition. Systematically generating evidence from long-term, high-quality primary data on a range of factors (agricultural, environmental, socioeconomic, and health) at the household level is critical for designing adaptation strategies, particularly for subsistence farmers.           ,              Malnutrition is a challenge to the health and productivity of populations and is viewed as one of the five largest adverse health impacts of climate change. Nonetheless, systematic evidence quantifying these impacts is currently limited. Our aim was to assess the scientific evidence base for the impact of climate change on childhood undernutrition (particularly stunting) in subsistence farmers in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed and gray full-text documents in English with no limits for year of publication or study design. Fifteen manuscripts were reviewed. Few studies use primary data to investigate the proportion of stunting that can be attributed to climate/weather variability. Although scattered and limited, current evidence suggests a significant but variable link between weather variables, e.g., rainfall, extreme weather events (floods/droughts), seasonality, and temperature, and childhood stunting at the household level (12 of 15 studies, 80\%). In addition, we note that agricultural, socioeconomic, and demographic factors at the household and individual levels also play substantial roles in mediating the nutritional impacts. Comparable interdisciplinary studies based on primary data at a household level are urgently required to guide effective adaptation, particularly for rural subsistence farmers. Systemization of data collection at the global level is indispensable and urgent. We need to assimilate data from long-term, high-quality agricultural, environmental, socioeconomic, health, and demographic surveillance systems and develop robust statistical methods to establish and validate causal links, quantify impacts, and make reliable predictions that can guide evidence-based health interventions in the future.},

Malaria remains one of the most serious infectious diseases; it threatens nearly half of the world's population and led to hundreds of thousands of deaths in 2015, predominantly among children in Africa. Malaria is managed through a combination of vector control approaches (such as insecticide spraying and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets) and drugs for both treatment and prevention. The widespread use of artemisinin-based combination therapies has contributed to substantial declines in the number of malaria-related deaths; however, the emergence of drug resistance threatens to reverse this progress. Advances in our understanding of the underlying molecular basis of pathogenesis have fuelled the development of new diagnostics, drugs and insecticides. Several new combination therapies are in clinical development that have efficacy against drug-resistant parasites and the potential to be used in single-dose regimens to improve compliance. This ambitious programme to eliminate malaria also includes new approaches that could yield malaria vaccines or novel vector control strategies. However, despite these achievements, a well-coordinated global effort on multiple fronts is needed if malaria elimination is to be achieved.}

We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly – in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time – from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.}

  abstract = {The coordination of humanitarian relief, e.g. in a natural disaster or a conflict situation, is often complicated by a scarcity of data to inform planning. Remote sensing imagery, from satellites or drones, can give important insights into conditions on the ground, including in areas which are difficult to access. Applications include situation awareness after natural disasters, structural damage assessment in conflict, monitoring human rights violations or population estimation in settlements. We review machine learning approaches for automating these problems, and discuss their potential and limitations. We also provide a case study of experiments using deep learning methods to count the numbers of structures in multiple refugee settlements in Africa and the Middle East. We find that while high levels of accuracy are possible, there is considerable variation in the characteristics of imagery collected from different sensors and regions. In this, as in the other applications discussed in the paper, critical inferences must be made from a relatively small amount of pixel data. We, therefore, consider that using machine learning systems as an augmentation of human analysts is a reasonable strategy to transition from current fully manual operational pipelines to ones which are both more efficient and have the necessary levels of quality control.

  abstract = {–K-fold cross-validation (CV) with squared error loss is widely used for evaluating predictive models, especially when strong distributional assumptions cannot be taken. However, CV with squared error loss is not free from distributional assumptions, in particular in cases involving non-iid data. This article analyzes CV for correlated data. We present a criterion for suitability of standard CV in presence of correlations. When this criterion does not hold, we introduce a bias corrected CV estimator which we term CVc, that yields an unbiased estimate of prediction error in many settings where standard CV is invalid. We also demonstrate our results numerically, and find that introducing our correction substantially improves both, model evaluation and model selection in simulations and real data studies.

  abstract = {The correct use of model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection techniques is vital in academic machine learning research as well as in many industrial settings. This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally, alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as the combined F-test 5x2 cross-validation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine learning algorithms when datasets are small.},

  abstract = {Despite the wide adoption of spike-and-slab methodology for Bayesian variable selection, its potential for penalized likelihood estimation has largely been overlooked. In this article, we bridge this gap by cross-fertilizing these two paradigms with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure for variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression. We introduce a new class of self-adaptive penalty functions that arise from a fully Bayes spike-and-slab formulation, ultimately moving beyond the separable penalty framework. A virtue of these nonseparable penalties is their ability to borrow strength across coordinates, adapt to ensemble sparsity information and exert multiplicity adjustment. The Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure harvests efficient coordinate-wise implementations with a path-following scheme for dynamic posterior exploration. We show on simulated data that the fully Bayes penalty mimics oracle performance, providing a viable alternative to cross-validation. We develop theory for the separable and nonseparable variants of the penalty, showing rate-optimality of the global mode as well as optimal posterior concentration when p {$>$} n.

  abstract = {The safe, highly effective measles vaccine has been recommended globally since 1974, yet in 2017 there were more than 17~million cases of measles and 83,400~deaths in children under 5~years old, and more than 99\% of both occurred in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)1–4. Globally comparable, annual, local estimates of routine first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage are critical for understanding geographically precise immunity patterns, progress towards the targets of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), and high-risk areas amid disruptions to vaccination programmes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)5–8. Here we generated annual estimates of routine childhood MCV1 coverage at 5~×~5-km2 pixel and second administrative levels from 2000 to 2019 in 101 LMICs, quantified geographical inequality and assessed vaccination status by geographical remoteness. After widespread MCV1 gains from 2000 to 2010, coverage regressed in more than half of the districts between 2010 and 2019, leaving many LMICs far from the GVAP goal of 80\% coverage in all districts by 2019. MCV1 coverage was lower in rural than in urban locations, although a larger proportion of unvaccinated children overall lived in urban locations; strategies to provide essential vaccination services should address both geographical contexts. These results provide a tool for decision-makers to strengthen routine MCV1 immunization programmes and provide equitable disease protection for all children.},

  abstract = {Structured additive regression (STAR) provides a general framework for complex Gaussian and non-Gaussian regression models, with predictors comprising arbitrary combinations of nonlinear functions and surfaces, spatial effects, varying coefficients, random effects, and further regression terms. The large flexibility of STAR makes function selection a challenging and important task, aiming at (1) selecting the relevant covariates, (2) choosing an appropriate and parsimonious representation of the impact of covariates on the predictor, and (3) determining the required interactions. We propose a spike-and-slab prior structure for function selection that allows to include or exclude single coefficients as well as blocks of coefficients representing specific model terms. A novel multiplicative parameter expansion is required to obtain good mixing and convergence properties in a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation approach and is shown to induce desirable shrinkage properties. In simulation studies and with (real) benchmark classification data, we investigate sensitivity to hyperparameter settings and compare performance to competitors. The flexibility and applicability of our approach are demonstrated in an additive piecewise exponential model with time-varying effects for right-censored survival times of intensive care patients with sepsis. Geoadditive and additive mixed logit model applications are discussed in an extensive online supplement.},

  abstract = {To obtain a probabilistic model for a dependent variable based on some set of explanatory variables, a distributional approach is often adopted where the parameters of the distribution are linked to regressors. In many classical models this only captures the location of the distribution but over the last decade there has been increasing interest in distributional regression approaches modeling all parameters including location, scale and shape. Notably, so-called nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR) models both mean and variance of a Gaussian response and is particularly popular in weather forecasting. Moreover, generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) provide a framework where each distribution parameter is modeled separately capturing smooth linear or nonlinear effects. However, when variable selection is required and/or there are nonsmooth dependencies or interactions (especially unknown or of high-order), it is challenging to establish a good GAMLSS. A natural alternative in these situations would be the application of regression trees or random forests but, so far, no general distributional framework is available for these. Therefore, a framework for distributional regression trees and forests is proposed that blends regression trees and random forests with classical distributions from the GAMLSS framework as well as their censored or truncated counterparts. To illustrate these novel approaches in practice, they are employed to obtain probabilistic precipitation forecasts at numerous sites in a mountainous region (Tyrol, Austria) based on a large number of numerical weather prediction quantities. It is shown that the novel distributional regression forests automatically select variables and interactions, performing on par or often even better than GAMLSS specified either through prior meteorological knowledge or a computationally more demanding boosting approach.},

  abstract = {To meet the SDG requirement of spatial disaggregation of indicators, several methods have been developed to generate estimates of under-five mortality at the sub-national level. The reliability of sub-national mortality estimates in children aged 5-14 with the available survey data has not been evaluated so far. We generate Admin-1 sub-national estimates of the risk of dying in children aged less than five (               5               q               0               ) and those aged 5 to 14 years old (               10               q               5               ). We use 96 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in 20 Sub-Saharan countries having at least 3 surveys designed to be representative at a sub-national level. The estimates account for the complex sample design of DHS and HIV-related biases in young children. A Bayesian space-time model previously developed for under-five mortality is used to smooth estimates across space and time in both age groups to reduce problems associated with data sparsity. The posterior distributions of the probability               10               q               5               are used to compute coefficients of variation and assess precision. Sufficiently precise estimates are retained to study the sub-national relationship between age-specific mortality rates (               5               q               0               and               10               q               5               ), accounting for uncertainty in sub-national levels. Out of 1,132 space-time estimates, 62.3\% are considered sufficiently precise with high heterogeneity across countries. Across all periods, sub-national estimates of mortality in children aged 0-4 are highly correlated with those in older children and young adolescents but this correlation is largely driven by the mortality decline. Within specific periods of time, it is often impossible to assess the relationship between mortality rates in the two age groups at the sub-national level, except in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia. As increased attention is devoted to survival after age 5, more research is needed to ensure that sub-national areas with specific interventions required for older children can be correctly identified.},

  abstract = {A history of insufficient nutritional intake is reflected by low anthropometric measures and can lead to growth failures, limited mental development, poor health outcomes and a higher risk of dying. Children below five years are among those most vulnerable and, while improvements in the share of children affected by insufficient nutritional intake has been observed, both sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have a disproportionately high share of growth failures and large disparities at national and sub-national levels. In this study, we use a Bayesian distributional regression approach to develop models for the standard anthropometric measures, stunting and wasting. This approach allows us to model both the mean and the standard deviation of the underlying response distribution. Accordingly, the whole distribution of the anthropometric measures can be evaluated. This is of particular importance, considering the fact that (severe) growth failures of children are defined having a z-score below −2 (−3), emphasising the need to extend the analysis beyond the conditional mean. In addition, we merge individual data taken from the Demographic and Health Surveys with remote sensed data for a large sample of 38 countries located in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia for the period 1990–2016, in order to combine individual and household specific characteristics with geophysical and environmental characteristics, and to allow for a comparison over time. Our results show besides gender differences across space, and strong non-linear effects of included socio-economic characteristics, in particular for maternal education and the wealth of the household that, surprisingly, in the presence of socio-economic characteristics, remote sensed data does not contribute to variations in growth failures, and including a pure spatial effect excluding remote sensed data leads to even better results. Further, while all regions showed improvements towards the target of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our analysis identifies hotspots of growth failures at sub-national levels within India, Nigeria, Niger, and Madagascar, emphasising the need to accelerate progress to reach the target set by the SDGs.},

Temperature is known to influence transmission intensity through its effects on the population growth of the mosquito vector and on pathogen development within the vector. Spatiotemporal data at a regional scale in highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia supplied an opportunity to examine how the spatial distribution of the disease changes with the interannual variability of temperature. We provide evidence for an increase in the altitude of malaria distribution in warmer years, which implies that climate change will, without mitigation, result in an increase of the malaria burden in the densely populated highlands of Africa and South America.}

  abstract = {Background Malaria burden in Uganda has declined disproportionately among regions despite overall high intervention coverage across all regions. The Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) 2014–15 was the second nationally representative survey conducted to provide estimates of malaria prevalence among children less than 5 years, and to track the progress of control interventions in the country. In this present study, 2014–15 MIS data were analysed to assess intervention effects on malaria prevalence in Uganda among children less than 5 years, assess intervention effects at regional level, and estimate geographical distribution of malaria prevalence in the country. Methods Bayesian geostatistical models with spatially varying coefficients were used to determine the effect of interventions on malaria prevalence at national and regional levels. Spike-and-slab variable selection was used to identify the most important predictors and forms. Bayesian kriging was used to predict malaria prevalence at unsampled locations. Results Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) ownership had a significant but varying protective effect on malaria prevalence. However, no effect was observed for Artemisinin Combination-based Therapies (ACTs). Environmental factors, namely, land cover, rainfall, day and night land surface temperature, and area type were significantly associated with malaria prevalence. Malaria prevalence was higher in rural areas, increased with the child’s age, and decreased with higher household socioeconomic status and higher level of mother’s education. The highest prevalence of malaria in children less than 5 years was predicted for regions of East Central, North East and West Nile, whereas the lowest was predicted in Kampala and South Western regions, and in the mountainous areas in Mid-Western and Mid-Eastern regions. Conclusions IRS and ITN ownership are important interventions against malaria prevalence in children less than 5 years in Uganda. The varying effects of the interventions calls for selective implementation of control tools suitable to regional ecological settings. To further reduce malaria burden and sustain malaria control in Uganda, current tools should be supplemented by health system strengthening, and socio-economic development.},

In the first extension, called Subspace Boosting (SubBoost), base-learners can consist of several variables, allowing for multivariable updates in a single iteration. To compensate for the larger flexibility, the ultimate selection of base-learners is based on information criteria leading to an automatic stopping of the algorithm. As the second extension, Random Subspace Boosting (RSubBoost) additionally includes a random preselection of base-learners in each iteration, enabling the scalability to high-dimensional data. In a third extension, called Adaptive Subspace Boosting (AdaSubBoost), an adaptive random preselection of base-learners is considered, focusing on base-learners which have proven to be predictive in previous iterations. Simulation results show that the multivariable updates in the three subspace algorithms are particularly beneficial in cases of high correlations among signal covariates. In several biomedical applications the proposed algorithms tend to yield sparser models than classical statistical boosting, while showing a very competitive predictive performance also compared to penalized regression approaches like the (relaxed) lasso and the elastic net.                                         Conclusions               The proposed randomized boosting approaches with multivariable base-learners are promising extensions of statistical boosting, particularly suited for highly-correlated and sparse high-dimensional settings. The incorporated selection of base-learners via information criteria induces automatic stopping of the algorithms, promoting sparser and more interpretable prediction models.},

  abstract = {High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are vital for measuring impacts of population growth, monitoring human-environment interactions and for planning and policy development. Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, “Random Forest” estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at \textasciitilde 100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

Our approach enables the simultaneous modeling of all distribution parameters of an arbitrary parametric distribution of a multivariate response conditional on explanatory variables, while being applicable to potentially high-dimensional data. Moreover, the boosting algorithm incorporates data-driven variable selection, taking various different types of effects into account. As a special merit of our approach, it allows for modelling the association between multiple continuous or discrete outcomes through the relevant covariates. After a detailed simulation study investigating estimation and prediction performance, we demonstrate the full flexibility of our approach in three diverse biomedical applications. The first is based on high-dimensional genomic cohort data from the UK Biobank, considering a bivariate binary response (chronic ischemic heart disease and high cholesterol). Here, we are able to identify genetic variants that are informative for the association between cholesterol and heart disease. The second application considers the demand for health care in Australia with the number of consultations and the number of prescribed medications as a bivariate count response. The third application analyses two dimensions of childhood undernutrition in Nigeria as a bivariate response and we find that the correlation between the two undernutrition scores is considerably different depending on the child's age and the region the child lives in.},

Statistical boosting is a computational approach that emerged from machine learning, which allows to fit regression models in the presence of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, the algorithm can lead to data-driven variable selection. In practice, however, the final models typically tend to include too many variables in some situations. This occurs particularly for low-dimensional data ([Formula: see text]), where we observe a slow overfitting behavior of boosting. As a result, more variables get included into the final model without altering the prediction accuracy. Many of these false positives are incorporated with a small coefficient and therefore have a small impact, but lead to a larger model. We try to overcome this issue by giving the algorithm the chance to deselect base-learners with minor importance. We analyze the impact of the new approach on variable selection and prediction performance in comparison to alternative methods including boosting with earlier stopping as well as twin boosting. We illustrate our approach with data of an ongoing cohort study for chronic kidney disease patients, where the most influential predictors for the health-related quality of life measure are selected in a distributional regression approach based on beta regression.},

All WHO regions currently target measles elimination by 2020, yet continued measles circulation makes that goal seem elusive. Using Demographic and Health Surveys with generalized additive models, we quantify spatial patterns of measles vaccination in ten contiguous countries in the African Great Lakes region between 2009–2014. Seven countries have ‘coldspots’ where vaccine coverage is below the WHO target of 80\%. Over 14 million children under 5 years of age live in coldspots across the region, and a total of 8–12 million children are unvaccinated. Spatial patterns of vaccination do not map directly onto sub-national administrative units and transnational coldspots exist. Clustering of low vaccination areas may allow for pockets of susceptibility that sustain circulation despite high overall coverage. Targeting at-risk areas and transnational coordination are likely required to eliminate measles in the region.},

Model-based boosting is a tool to fit a statistical model while performing variable selection at the same time. A drawback of the fitting lies in the need of multiple model fits on slightly altered data (e.g., cross-validation or bootstrap) to find the optimal number of boosting iterations and prevent overfitting. In our proposed approach, we augment the data set with randomly permuted versions of the true variables, so-called shadow variables, and stop the stepwise fitting as soon as such a variable would be added to the model. This allows variable selection in a single fit of the model without requiring further parameter tuning. We show that our probing approach can compete with state-of-the-art selection methods like stability selection in a high-dimensional classification benchmark and apply it on three gene expression data sets.},

  abstract = {Disaggregated population counts are needed to calculate health, economic, and development indicators in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), especially in settings of rapid urbanisation. Censuses are often outdated and inaccurate in LMIC settings, and rarely disaggregated at fine geographic scale. Modelled gridded population datasets derived from census data have become widely used by development researchers and practitioners; however, accuracy in these datasets are evaluated at the spatial scale of model input data which is generally courser than the neighbourhood or cell-level scale of many applications. We simulate a realistic synthetic 2016 population in Khomas, Namibia, a majority urban region, and introduce several realistic levels of outdatedness (over 15 years) and inaccuracy in slum, non-slum, and rural areas. We aggregate the synthetic populations by census and administrative boundaries (to mimic census data), resulting in 32 gridded population datasets that are typical of LMIC settings using the WorldPop-Global-Unconstrained gridded population approach. We evaluate the cell-level accuracy of these gridded population datasets using the original synthetic population as a reference. In our simulation, we found large cell-level errors, particularly in slum cells. These were driven by the averaging of population densities in large areal units before model training. Age, accuracy, and aggregation of the input data also played a role in these errors. We suggest incorporating finer-scale training data into gridded population models generally, and WorldPop-Global-Unconstrained in particular (e.g., from routine household surveys or slum community population counts), and use of new building footprint datasets as a covariate to improve cell-level accuracy (as done in some new WorldPop-Global-Constrained datasets). It is important to measure accuracy of gridded population datasets at spatial scales more consistent with how the data are being applied, especially if they are to be used for monitoring key development indicators at neighbourhood scales within cities.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining machine learning and satellite images to estimate wealth in sub-Saharan African countries (Xie et al., 2016, Jean et al., 2016). In this study, we investigate the extent to which this method can be applied in the context of the Philippine archipelago to predict four different socioeconomic indicators: wealth level, years of education, access to electricity, and access to water. We also propose an alternative, cost-effective approach that leverages a combination of volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap and nighttime lights satellite imagery for estimating socioeconomic indicators. The best models, which incorporate regional indicators as predictors, explain approximately 63\% of the variation in asset-based wealth. Our findings also indicate that models trained on publicly available, volunteer-curated geographic data achieve the same predictive performance as that of models trained using proprietary satellite images.},

  abstract = {According to 2016 official estimates, almost 60\% of the rural population in Mexico (16.9 million people) had income levels below the poverty line, and approximately 29.2\% (8.3 million) could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most poverty research disregards gender and exclusively analyzes average income or the expected probability of being poor, we depart from these approaches by examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families. Focusing on identifying heterogeneous effects according to the sex of the household head, we apply additive quantile models to a cross-sectional dataset containing information on 4,434 women-headed and 14,877 men-headed households. For each model, we introduce 45 variables at the individual/household, community, and regional levels. Two major contributions emerge from this paper. First, the identification of a subset of significant factors whose effect is independent of the head’s sex and is relevant for poor and extremely poor families. This is found for the variables credit card ownership, access to basic housing services, education level, and satisfaction with public services. Second, results also identify a subset of significant factors with an uneven effect on income according to the sex of the head that is observed both in the poor and extremely poor households. Variables having this gendered effect are the community’s income inequality, municipal human development, social networks, access to social security, and gender-based violence against women in the public sphere. Out of these, particularly relevant is the effect of the last three factors, whose association with income has not been explored before for rural Mexico and for which the bias among sexes increases as family income grows from extreme poverty to poverty level.},

There appears to be some confusion among researchers, however, about best practices for cross-validation, and about the interpretation of cross-validation results. In particular, repeated cross-validation is often advocated, and so is the reporting of standard deviations, confidence intervals, or an indication of "significance". In this paper, we argue that, under many practical circumstances, when the goal of the experiments is to see how well the model returned by a learner will perform in practice in a particular domain, repeated cross-validation is not useful, and the reporting of confidence intervals or significance is misleading. Our arguments are supported by experimental results.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Local policymakers require information about public health, housing and well-being at small geographical areas. A municipality can for example use this information to organize targeted activities with the aim of improving the well-being of their residents. Surveys are often used to gather data, but many neighborhoods can have only few or even zero respondents. In that case, estimating the status of the local population directly from survey responses is prone to be unreliable.                                         Methods               Small Area Estimation (SAE) is a technique to provide estimates at small geographical levels with only few or even zero respondents. In classical individual-level SAE, a complex statistical regression model is fitted to the survey responses by using auxiliary administrative data for the population as predictors, the missing responses are then predicted and aggregated to the desired geographical level. In this paper we compare gradient boosted trees (XGBoost), a well-known machine learning technique, to a structured additive regression model (STAR) designed for the specific problem of estimating public health and well-being in the whole population of the Netherlands.                                         Results               We compare the accuracy and performance of these models using out-of-sample predictions with five-fold Cross Validation (5CV). We do this for three data sets of different sample sizes and outcome types. Compared to the STAR model, gradient boosted trees are able to improve both the accuracy of the predictions and the total time taken to get these predictions. Even though the models appear quite similar in overall accuracy, the small area predictions at neighborhood level sometimes differ significantly. It may therefore make sense to pursue slightly more accurate models for better predictions into small areas. However, one of the biggest benefits is that XGBoost does not require prior knowledge or model specification. Data preparation and modelling is much easier, since the method automatically handles missing data, non-linear responses, interactions and accounts for spatial correlation structures.                                         Conclusions               In this paper we provide new nationwide estimates of health, housing and well-being indicators at neighborhood level in the Netherlands, see ’Online materials’. We demonstrate that machine learning provides a good alternative to complex statistical regression modelling for small area estimation in terms of accuracy, robustness, speed and data preparation. These results can be used to make appropriate policy decisions at a local level and make recommendations about which estimation methods are beneficial in terms of accuracy, time and budget constraints.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of the under-five mortality rate in a developing world context are a key barometer of the health of a nation. This paper describes a new model to analyze survey data on mortality in this context. We are interested in both spatial and temporal description, that is wishing to estimate under-five mortality rate across regions and years and to investigate the association between the under-five mortality rate and spatially varying covariate surfaces. We illustrate the methodology by producing yearly estimates for subnational areas in Kenya over the period 1980–2014 using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, which use stratified cluster sampling. We use a binomial likelihood with fixed effects for the urban/rural strata and random effects for the clustering to account for the complex survey design. Smoothing is carried out using Bayesian hierarchical models with continuous spatial and temporally discrete components. A key component of the model is an offset to adjust for bias due to the effects of HIV epidemics. Substantively, there has been a sharp decline in Kenya in the under-five mortality rate in the period 1980–2014, but large variability in estimated subnational rates remains. A priority for future research is understanding this variability. In exploratory work, we examine whether a variety of spatial covariate surfaces can explain the variability in under-five mortality rate. Temperature, precipitation, a measure of malaria infection prevalence, and a measure of nearness to cities were candidates for inclusion in the covariate model, but the interplay between space, time, and covariates is complex.},

These surveys provide decision markers with key measures of population demographics, health and nutrition, which allow informed policy evaluation to be made. Though standard health indicators are routinely published in survey final reports, much of the value of DHS is derived from the ability to download and analyse standardised microdata datasets for subgroup analysis, pooled multi-country analysis, and extended research studies. We have developed an open-source freely available R package ‘rdhs’ to facilitate management and processing of DHS survey data. The package provides a suite of tools to (1) access standard survey indicators through the DHS Program API, (2) identify all survey datasets that include a particular topic or indicator relevant to a particular analysis, (3) directly download survey datasets from the DHS website, (4) load datasets and data dictionaries into R, and (5) extract variables and pool harmonised datasets for multi-survey analysis. We detail the core functionality of ‘rdhs’ by demonstrating how the package can be used to firstly compare trends in the prevalence of anaemia among women between countries before conducting secondary analysis to assess for the relationship between education and anemia.},

  abstract = {In this essay we make four interrelated points. First, we reiterate previous arguments (Kleinberg et al 2015) that forecasting problems are more common in social science than is often appreciated. From this observation it follows that social scientists should care about predictive accuracy in addition to unbiased or consistent estimation of causal relationships. Second, we argue that social scientists should be interested in prediction even if they have no interest in forecasting per se. Whether they do so explicitly or not, that is, causal claims necessarily make predictions; thus it is both fair and arguably useful to hold them accountable for the accuracy of the predictions they make. Third, we argue that prediction, used in either of the above two senses, is a useful metric for quantifying progress. Important differences between social science explanations and machine learning algorithms notwithstanding, social scientists can still learn from approaches like the Common Task Framework (CTF) which have successfully driven progress in certain fields of AI over the past 30 years (Donoho, 2015). Finally, we anticipate that as the predictive performance of forecasting models and explanations alike receives more attention, it will become clear that it is subject to some upper limit which lies well below deterministic accuracy for many applications of interest (Martin et al 2016). Characterizing the properties of complex social systems that lead to higher or lower predictive limits therefore poses an interesting challenge for computational social science.},

  abstract = {Most major population surveys used by social scientists are based on complex sampling designs where sampling units have different probabilities of being selected. Although sampling weights must generally be used to derive unbiased estimates of univariate population characteristics, the decision about their use in regression analysis is more complicated. Where sampling weights are solely a function of independent variables included in the model, unweighted OLS estimates are preferred because they are unbiased, consistent, and have smaller standard errors than weighted OLS estimates. Where sampling weights are a function of the dependent variable (and thus of the error term), we recommend first attempting to respecify the model so that they are solely a function of the independent variables. If this can be accomplished, then unweighted OLS is again preferred. If the model cannot be respecified, then estimation of the model using sampling weights may be appropriate. In this case, however, the formula used by most computer programs for calculating standard errors will be incorrect. We recommend using the White heteroskedastic consistent estimator for the standard errors.},

  abstract = {In low- and middle-income countries, household surveys are the most reliable data source to examine health and demographic indicators at the subnational level, an exercise in small area estimation. Model-based unit-level models are favored in producing the subnational estimates at fine scale, such as the admin-2 level. Typically, the surveys employ stratified two-stage cluster sampling with strata consisting of an urban/rural designation crossed with administrative regions. To avoid bias and increase predictive precision, the stratification should be acknowledged in the analysis. To move from the cluster to the area requires an aggregation step in which the prevalence surface is averaged with respect to population density. This requires estimating a partition of the study area into its urban and rural components, and to do this we experiment with a variety of classification algorithms, including logistic regression, Bayesian additive regression trees and gradient boosted trees. Pixel-level covariate surfaces are used to improve prediction. We estimate spatial HIV prevalence in women of age 15-49 in Malawi using the stratification/aggregation method we propose.},

Models can explain 70\% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in countries where the model was not trained, outperforming previous benchmarks from high-resolution imagery, and comparison with independent wealth measurements from censuses suggests that errors in satellite estimates are comparable to errors in existing ground data. Satellite-based estimates can also explain up to 50\% of the variation in district-aggregated changes in wealth over time, with daytime imagery particularly useful in this task. We demonstrate the utility of satellite-based estimates for research and policy, and demonstrate their scalability by creating a wealth map for Africa’s most populous country.},

  abstract = {In this article, we study the causal inference problem with a continuous treatment variable using propensity score-based methods. For a continuous treatment, the generalized propensity score is defined as the conditional density of the treatment-level given covariates (confounders). The dose–response function is then estimated by inverse probability weighting, where the weights are calculated from the estimated propensity scores. When the dimension of the covariates is large, the traditional nonparametric density estimation suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Some researchers have suggested a two-step estimation procedure by first modeling the mean function. In this study, we suggest a boosting algorithm to estimate the mean function of the treatment given covariates. In boosting, an important tuning parameter is the number of trees to be generated, which essentially determines the trade-off between bias and variance of the causal estimator. We propose a criterion called average absolute correlation coefficient (AACC) to determine the optimal number of trees. Simulation results show that the proposed approach performs better than a simple linear approximation or L2 boosting. The proposed methodology is also illustrated through the Early Dieting in Girls study, which examines the influence of mothers’ overall weight concern on daughters’ dieting behavior.},

  abstract = {Geographically disaggregated poverty data are vital for better understanding development issues and ensuring development efforts are directed to the places where they are most needed. Poverty has traditionally been measured by data on consumption, income, or assets. However, recent advances in computing power and the emergence of new methods has made it increasingly feasible to produce reliable, cost-effective, and timely poverty maps by extracting features from novel data sources such as satellite imagery, call detail records, and internet connectivity indicators. This paper explores the methodological implications of using both traditional and novel data sources to generate poverty maps. Specifically, it examines the applications of (i) survey and census data; (ii) Global System for Mobile Communications, smartphone, and Wi-Fi indicators; (iii) call detail records; (iv) daytime and nighttime remote sensing imagery; and (v) the Survey of Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking for poverty mapping. Each section provides a brief overview of the data requirements, methodology, and applicability considerations of the data source under consideration. In addition, the paper discusses the usefulness and limitations of each approach in the field of evaluation, providing concrete examples of poverty maps created from each of the listed data sources.},

For decades, research into conflict-linked environmental damage and its links to human health have been overlooked and research underfunded, hindering a complete humanitarian response and effective post-conflict reconstruction. Recent developments in the field of open-source investigation have shown promising results due to the increased use of mobile phones, access to the internet and freely available methods for remote observation by satellite. Utilizing and analysing these sources of data can help us to understand how conflicts are associated with environmental damage, pollution and their negative impacts upon public health. Further research and development in this field will help to inform more effective humanitarian responses, mitigate risks to health and identify priorities for post-conflict reconstruction programs. Data-driven open-source research can also strengthen international discussions on state accountability for military activities and build a case for the responsibility of warring parties to protect the environment as well as the people who depend on it.},
